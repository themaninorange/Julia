# Julia

The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers $c$, for which this iterative function converges:

$$z_0 = 0, \qquad z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$$

For each $c$, there is a corresponding Julia set of the values the $z_0$ that will cause this function to converge.

It is also possible to iterate this function with the quaternion numbers, because the only multiplication performed is the squaring of the previous value.

This program shows the Mandelbrot set alonside the Julia set generated by these $c$ values, with values taken from quaternion space.
